Cognizant-AI-Virtual-Experience-Program
Enrolled in 'Artificial Intelligence Virtual Experience Program' by Cognizant as a 'Data Scientist' with affiliation to Forage. Worked on a business problem statement with 'Gala Groceries' by implementing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Modeling, Model Building and Interpretation, Machine Learning Production & Quality Assurance. Also, gained insights for optimizing the required business problem while contributing recommendations for the given business problem.

Built a Unified Modelling Language (UML) Diagram for business strategic planning.
Incorporated data exploration, data cleaning & data Merging (Data Wrangling).
Performed feature engineering & used k-fold cross validation.
Implemented data modelling by utilizing Random Forest Regressor model for prediction.
Computed accuracy using mean absolute error (MAE).
Performed Feature importance to check relevant features in the dataset.
Made alluring & comprehensible presentations for the client.


1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
After collecting the data, EDA is performed using Python (Jupiter Notebook and google colab) and its libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, etc . Brief information aobut this task as below.

Dataset consists of following details:
Data columns (total 9 columns):
Looking at the output of the .info() method, we can intepret each column as follows:

transaction_id = this is a unique ID that is assigned to each transaction
timestamp = this is the datetime at which the transaction was made
product_id = this is an ID that is assigned to the product that was sold. Each product has a unique ID
category = this is the category that the product is contained within
customer_type = this is the type of customer that made the transaction
unit_price = the price that 1 unit of this item sells for
quantity = the number of units sold for this product within this transaction
total = the total amount payable by the customer
payment_type = the payment method used by the customer



Visualisation
I looked at the distributions of the data and value counts for various categorical variables. Below are some visualizations from EDA.

The column named 'timestamp' appears to be categorical but it's a date column. So, I converted timestamp to datetime format. Created a 'hour' column for further analysis.

Worked for a business problem statement on 'Gala Groceries' (dataset@ Client_size-7829,9) by implementing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Modelling with Python & libraries, prepared Strategic plan in PowerPoint.
• Model Building and Interpretation- Data Cleaned, merged, Feature Engineering, etc
• Machine Learning Production with Random Forest Classifier, K-fold strategy, obtained Average MAE- 24%, etc
